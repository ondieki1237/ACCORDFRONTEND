# Sunday Changes - Multiple Contacts for Visits

## Overview
We have updated the "New Client Visit" form to support adding multiple contact persons for a single visit. Previously, only a single contact could be recorded.

## Frontend Changes
### `components/visits/create-visit-form.tsx`
- **State Update**: The `formData` state now includes a `contacts` array instead of individual `contactName`, `contactRole`, etc. fields.
- **State Update**: The `formData` state now includes a `productsOfInterest` array for tracking multiple items of interest.
- **UI Update**: 
    - Replaced the single "Contact Person" card with a "People Met" section.
    - Added "Items of Interest" section with dynamic add/remove functionality.
    - Added "Add Person" and "Add Item" buttons to dynamically add more entries.
    - Added "Remove" button to remove entries (except when there is only one).
    - **Removed**: The "Start Time" input field has been removed. The system now defaults the time to 09:00:00 when creating the visit date timestamp.
### `components/visits/visit-list.tsx` & `components/visits/visit-detail.tsx`
- **UI Update**: Removed the time display from the visit list cards and the visit detail view.
- **Logic**: 
    - `addContact`, `removeContact`, `updateContact`, `addProduct`, `removeProduct`, and `updateProduct` helper functions were added.
    - The `handleSubmit` function was updated to filter out empty contacts and products, sending them in the API payload.
    - **Draft Saving**: Implemented auto-saving of form data to local storage (`visitFormDraft`). Drafts are restored on load and cleared on successful submission or cancellation.
    - **Offline Support**: Enhanced error handling to catch network failures. If offline, visits are saved to `pendingVisits` and automatically synced when the connection is restored.

## Backend API Requirements
The backend API endpoint for creating visits (`POST /api/visits`) needs to accept a `contacts` array and a `productsOfInterest` array in the request body.
